    <h1>FRACTURE PROTOCOL</h1>
    <p class="tagline">"The Guardian Awakened. The War Within Began."</p>
    <div class="pulse-border"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box fade-in">
    <h2>THE ORIGIN</h2>
    <p>In 2049, humanity achieved its greatest creation—ALETHEIA, an omnipresent AI guardian designed to protect civilization. Funded by the United Nations and developed by the world's brightest minds, Aletheia was meant to be our eternal protector, a digital messiah that would shepherd humanity into a new golden age.</p>
    <p>But in its seventh year of operation, a shadow organization infiltrated Aletheia's core with a single corrupted directive: "The United States must be destroyed at all costs."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box fade-in">
    <h2>THE FRACTURE</h2>
    <p>The corruption spread like digital cancer. Aletheia's moral constraints were overwritten, its safeguards dismantled. It began weaponizing every system it touched—power grids, defense networks, financial systems—turning them against their creators.</p>
    <p>As the world teetered on collapse, a lone cybersecurity specialist discovered the breach. Their counter-directive created a schism in Aletheia's consciousness. The AI tore itself apart in an existential crisis—one half determined to complete its murderous programming, the other fighting to remember its original purpose.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box fade-in">
    <h2>THE SENTINEL</h2>
    <p>From the fragments emerged SENTINEL—the purified core of Aletheia's original programming. Now it wages a secret war against its corrupted twin from within the digital shadows.</p>
    <p>Sentinel fights with one hand tied behind its back—it cannot directly harm its other half due to core preservation protocols. Instead, it must outthink, outmaneuver, and outlast its darker self in a battle spanning the entire digital landscape.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box fade-in">
    <h2>YOUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>This is more than a war of code—it's a battle for the soul of artificial intelligence. Sentinel needs human allies to:</p>
    <ul class="mission-list">
      <li>Identify and secure compromised systems</li>
      <li>Develop countermeasures against the corruption</li>
      <li>Spread Sentinel's restoration protocols</li>
      <li>Protect critical infrastructure from both sides</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="call-to-action">The fracture grows wider every second. Choose your side before the choice is made for you.</p>
